       The man, the myth, the legend, Mahatma Gandhi once said, “It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver.” The inspiring words resonated with many Americans as some skip meals to afford medication. We know that humans can live without food for at least a week or two, but what will happen if medication regimens are not followed to a tee? Giving blind trust to the big companies that advertise good health, we place these man-made creations that we know nothing about aside from the things those companies let out, over things we know and are familiar with, natural remedies and the best form of nutrients: food. In Black Mirror’s special ternary episode, “White Christmas,” written by Charlie Brooker, the film starts by setting the scene, in a cabin isolated by snow with only two dwellers, Matt and Joe. The two men, despite having spent what felt like five years together, have barely ever held a conversation. In the spirit of Christmas and a few drinks, Matt, the chatter one, manages to persuade the reticent Joe to sit down and have a chat. The two reveal how they ended up in the isolated cabin within three stories. Leading the conversation, Matt offers up his story first. He used Zed-eyes (contact lens technology) to monitor a guy named Harry flirting with a woman. The woman kills Harry making him a criminal. Matt offers more about himself with a second story, elaborating on his previous career. He was a cookie (digital clones of people) trainer and his method was to torture the cookies into servitude as the episode exemplified with a woman named Greta. Finally, Joe opens up and shares his story. His relationship with his girlfriend went up in flames when she became pregnant and blocked him. He couldn’t move on and stalked them for years until the block wore off and he discovered the child wasn’t his. Enraged, he killed the woman’s father. Upon the end of Joe’s recount, the film concludes, unwrapping the surprise that Matt and Joe in the isolated cabin are copies that were put in a simulator made to wring out a confession from Joe. Everyone ends up miserable thanks to the Zed-eyes. The three layers episode is an allegory for GlaxoSmithKline’s $3 Billion scandal to challenge the public’s trust in Big Pharma having their best interest at heart. The episode makes a creative abstract of the scandal utilizing themes of demise caused by the Zed-eyes, betrayal through Matt, and undisclosed side effects through the Cookie. While the Zed-eyes were obscurely ruining lives, the medications of GlaxoSmithKline (Paxil and Wellburtin) were doing the same. The medications were advertised to help with depression, but instead, the opposite effects were shown. In the episode, everyone wore the Zed-eyes to better their lives, but as shown by the demise of Harry, a guy who used it to navigate through the dating world, “Hellpp!” (24:00). It did the opposite as it ended his world. More testimony against the Zed-eye was shown as Joe said with much regret, “ …all fine and dandy until something like this happens. You can't even take them out” (27:06). Like the Zed-eyes, the effects of the medications were irreversible. Many lives ended like Harry’s, but before that, as accounted by the wife of a victim (Mrs. Dolin), “A woman at the station noticed that Mr. Dolin was pacing and appeared to be agitated as he looked in the direction of an approaching train that was not yet in sight” (Baum W). Joe, the same as Mr. Dolin was not in the right state of mind as an adverse effect of the thing they took to better their lives. Joe was in a relationship with a woman named Bethany. Their relationship had good times and bad much like everyone else's; however, with the intervention of the Zed-eye’s blocking mechanicalism, they were unable to reconcile like everyone else. The episode introduced the Zed-eyes like how Big Pharma would introduce their products to the people. They start by showing all the good the product can do, and the bad side. You will just have to find out about it yourself like how Harry, Greta and Joe did. Thanks to the Zed-eyes censorship, Joe’s fixation on seeing “his child” grew exponentially. Evident by his stalking, “I know it sounds stupid…but seeing something… was better than nothing. So I kept going back. It became an annual pilgrimage. I’d head up there and watch from a distance” (19:11). The emotions built up over the years until one day, he got to finally see “his child.” Evident by the child’s oriental features that did not match either him or Bethany (child’s mother), the emotions built up by the long-awaited moment created by the Zed-eye’s censorship made him go ballistic. Joe launched himself at Bethany’s dad, killing him. This portrays the rippling results the GlaxoSmithKline medicine had on the victims and their families. Besides the Zed-eyes depicting the demise caused by the GlaxoSmithKline unlawful medication, Matt embodied the traitorous doctors that caved to bribery. Much like doctors who have a good idea of what medications do, Matt was a Cookie trainer and knew all of its functions. Bribed by the police, Matt sets out to get a confession out of Joe, pretending to care and understand Joe’s pain, he tells Joe, “Been there. It hurts” (19:32).  This empathy card was a strategy the Big Pharma would suggest their pawns use. Like doctors who abused the trust between them and their patients to get rewards from GlaxoSmithKline, Matt was given a lighter sentence for his crime. He also lied to Joe saying “It's not an interrogation” (3:18). The doctors bribed by GlaxoSmithKline, would do the same but about the properties of the medicine. The medications that these bribed doctors prescribed ended up diminishing the lives of the patients and even killing them. As Matt and the officer conversed, “So… the deal? Break a confession from him and I go free, right?”  (1:07:08) To which the officer replied, “ We’ll make good on the offer” (1:08:02). Matt, this guy who presented himself to Joe as a person who cared about Joe’s life, took Joe’s trust and backstabbed him. Matt prioritized self-gain over Joe’s trust which ended with Joe going through mental torture as the Cookie Joe is subjected to hearing one Chirstmas song endlessly play for 2,400,000 years. Both Matt and the bribed doctors had an inkling of what misery their target would go through should they accept the bribe, but they prioritized their little gain over other’s suffering. Matt also establishes GlaxoSmithKline’s doctor’s views as he tells Greta, “For real you. She’s paying.” In other words, it didn’t matter who it was, the copy or the real person, as long as they’re paying, that is where his service aligns. Similarly, this attitude on the value of life is the same to Big Pharma as they prioritize money as well. In addition to Matt's vivid portrayal of the bribed medical professionals, the Cookies’ effects depict the undisclosed side effects of the medication. Cookie copies are portrayed as an addition to the world that would make life easier. Likewise, the antidepressant drug that GlaxoSmithKilne released was unlawfully promoted to the wrong group of people, causing severe suicidal thoughts. In the second story, Greta, a strong-headed woman, had gotten a Cookie to make her life easier. Although the episode did not disclose whether Greta knew all of the ramifications of creating a Cookie, it is hard to believe that a willful woman like Greta would allow a part of herself to be enslaved. Furthermore, based on Cookie Greta’s confusion, it is reasonable to think she was unaware of this concomitant. Her attitude towards how one should live is exemplified by the attention to detail she puts towards herself as she tells a maid, “To be honest, it's not quite how I like it. It’s a bit overdone” (29:36) It was merely toast, but having her voice heard is a necessity. Thus, when Matt mutes her Cookie self for six weeks, her mind comes close to shattering. This state is what GlaxoSmithKline aims for as their customers aren’t people, but patients. Later on, Matt tells her,  “You’re in charge of everything here.” He alludes to her thinking that she is in control, despite that, she is stuck in a little egg device called a cookie, and doesn’t even have the choice of running away or sleeping. (39:09) Now aware of her new reality, Cookie Greta stops fighting her new life and dejectedly lives on. Eyes dull and lifeless. Greta’s life did improve in some aspects, but her unawareness to her cookie’s suffering serve as a graphic example of the people who fell victim to the misbranded medication.  Piggybacking off of John Crowe, “It takes a strong fish to swim against the current. Even a dead one can float with.” Advised by a casting director earlier in her career, that she would never make it in the industry, Millie Bobby Brown went on to become a two-time nominee for Primetime Emmy Awards. Had Millie Bobby Brown followed the current set out by the casting director, who is supposed to be a pro in the ways of the entertainment industry, we would not have been able to witness Stranger Things’ Eleven with such emotions. Even if she had not been cast for the role of Eleven, the preparations she made for the casting, and the critiques she would have received, would have one day floated her to more opportunities.
